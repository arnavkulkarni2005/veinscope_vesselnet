# ðŸš€ Introduction

**VessenNet** is a deep learningâ€“powered system for the **automated segmentation and analysis of scleral (tear-zone) vein patterns** from high-resolution eye images. It is designed as a two-stage, custom architecture that combines the strengths of U-Net and SegNet into a novel framework called **VesselNet**.

## ðŸ§  What is VesselNet?

**VesselNet** is our custom hybrid model composed of:

- **U-Net**: First stage used to **crop and isolate the scleral region** from the eye image with precise anatomical localization.
- **SegNet**: Second stage used to **segment the tear vein structures** specifically within the extracted scleral area.

This modular design improves both anatomical accuracy and vascular continuity, making it ideal for segmenting fine, thin, and branching vein structures.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features

- CLAHE-based preprocessing to enhance visibility of vascular structures  
- Two-stage architecture for accurate region selection and segmentation  
- Extraction of biologically relevant features: vein density, tortuosity, branching, vessel width, and more  
- Optional health condition mapping (e.g., dehydration, fatigue) using clustering or rule-based heuristics  
- **FastAPI backend** for real-time inference  
- **Flutter app integration** for capturing eye images and displaying segmentation results directly on mobile  

---

## ðŸ’¡ Use Cases

- Non-invasive wellness screening using ocular biomarkers  
- Real-time vascular analysis from mobile devices  
- Research on scleral vein behavior under stress, fatigue, or hydration changes

**VessenNet** was developed during a hackathon to demonstrate the potential of deep learning and mobile-integrated health analysis from eye-based biometrics.
