VesselNet: A Deep Learning Vision for Proactive Eye HealthWelcome to the VesselNet project repository. This document outlines the architecture, features, and future vision of VesselNet, a novel system for non-invasive ocular health monitoring.Table of ContentsVision & MissionThe VesselNet ArchitectureKey FeaturesPotential ApplicationsFrom Hackathon to Health-Tech: Our RoadmapGetting StartedProject StructureRequirementsHow to ContributeLicenseVision & MissionIn an era of unprecedented digital screen time, eye strain and related health conditions are on the rise. Our mission is to empower individuals and clinicians with a proactive, non-invasive tool for monitoring ocular biomarkers. We envision VesselNet becoming a daily habit for the digitally-strained generation, transforming the smartphone camera into a powerful device for promoting long-term eye health and wellness.The VesselNet ArchitectureVesselNet is a custom, two-stage deep learning pipeline designed for the precise segmentation and analysis of scleral (tear-zone) vein patterns from high-resolution eye images. Our hybrid architecture ensures both anatomical accuracy and vascular continuity, which is critical for extracting meaningful biomarkers.This initial prototype was developed in an intense 36-hour hackathon, demonstrating our capability for rapid, high-impact development.The pipeline operates as follows:Preprocessing: An input eye image is enhanced using Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) to improve the visibility of fine vascular structures against the scleral background.Stage 1: Scleral Region Isolation (U-Net)A U-Net model, renowned for its precision in biomedical imaging, first identifies and crops the scleral region. This step eliminates noise from surrounding features (eyelids, iris) and provides a clean, anatomically correct Region of Interest (ROI).Stage 2: Vein Segmentation (SegNet)The isolated scleral ROI is fed into a SegNet model. SegNet's encoder-decoder architecture is particularly effective at preserving high-frequency details, making it ideal for segmenting the thin, intricate, and branching patterns of scleral veins.Post-processing & Feature Extraction:From the segmented vascular mask, we extract a rich set of biologically relevant features, including:Vein Density: Total vessel area relative to the scleral area.Tortuosity: A measure of how twisted or curved the veins are, often denoted as fracL_actualL_straight.Branching Analysis: Number of junctions and endpoints.Average Vessel Width: The mean thickness of the segmented veins.This modular, two-stage design significantly outperforms single-stage models by decoupling the tasks of localization and fine-grained segmentation.Key FeaturesHigh-Precision Two-Stage Architecture: Combines U-Net and SegNet for robust and accurate vascular segmentation.Advanced Preprocessing: Utilizes CLAHE to ensure model performance across various lighting conditions and image qualities.Rich Biomarker Extraction: Quantifies key vascular metrics like density, tortuosity, branching patterns, and width.Scalable Backend for Real-Time Analysis: A FastAPI backend provides a robust, high-performance API for on-demand inference.Seamless Mobile Integration: A Flutter application demonstrates a complete user flow—from image capture to displaying segmentation results and health insights on a mobile device.Potential ApplicationsVesselNet is designed to serve both individual users and medical professionals.For Personal WellnessDaily Health Tracking: Users can track changes in their scleral veins as potential indicators of fatigue, dehydration, or eye strain.Habit Formation: Encourages a daily check-in to build awareness and promote healthier screen-time habits.Non-invasive Wellness Screening: Provides accessible, at-home insights without the need for specialized hardware.For Clinical & Research UseClinician's Assistant: Offers doctors a quantitative, objective tool to supplement traditional examinations.Longitudinal Studies: Enables researchers to collect data on how scleral vascular patterns change in response to stress, medication, or specific health conditions.Telemedicine: Facilitates remote patient monitoring and preliminary diagnostics.From Hackathon to Health-Tech: Our RoadmapThis project was conceived and built within a 36-hour hackathon, serving as a powerful proof-of-concept. Our ambition is to evolve this prototype into a fully deployed, commercial-grade platform. We are actively seeking to extend this work and welcome collaboration.Phase 1: Refinement & Validation (Current Focus) Expand Dataset: Augment our training data with a more diverse set of images to improve model generalization. Model Optimization: Experiment with attention mechanisms and lighter backbones for improved accuracy and on-device performance. Longitudinal Analysis: Develop algorithms to track vascular changes in the same individual over time. UX/UI Enhancement: Refine the Flutter app for a more intuitive and engaging user experience.Phase 2: Deployment & Integration Cloud Deployment: Migrate the backend to a scalable cloud infrastructure (e.g., GCP, AWS) for public use. Publish Research: Document our unique architecture and findings in a scientific paper. API for Developers: Release a public API to allow other health and wellness apps to integrate VesselNet's capabilities.Phase 3: Commercialization & Clinical Trials Clinical Validation: Partner with ophthalmologists and research institutions to validate our extracted biomarkers against established medical standards. Regulatory Compliance: Pursue compliance with health data regulations (e.g., HIPAA) to enable clinical adoption. Feature Expansion: Integrate machine learning models to correlate vascular patterns with specific conditions like hypertension or diabetes, based on clinical data.This roadmap reflects a commitment to building a product that is not only technologically innovative but also scientifically rigorous and user-centric—a philosophy I am keen to bring to a forward-thinking company like Adobe.Getting StartedClone this repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/DL_Hack.git
